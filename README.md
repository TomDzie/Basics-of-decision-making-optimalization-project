## Schedule problem description
The restaurant uses a system where customers, must declare what time they will arrive,
what time they will leave and how much money they intend to spend before arriving.
The next day, only selected customers can appear, and they are selected so as to
maximize the restaurant's profit but number of reservations can't exceed the number of tables.
